      <p>
        In 2022, we founded our company with the belief that traditional
        businesses were suffering and needed help adapting to the digital age.
        Local shop owners were struggling to keep up with ecommerce players and
        the outbreak of Covid. We offer them a variety of services to help raise
        their business online.
        <br />
        <br />
        At our training program, we provide both training and guidance to help
        students start their journey in the IT field. We work closely with
        industry professionals to help make our programs as relevant and
        beneficial to our students as possible. Our ultimate goal is to help
        prepare them for a successful career in IT.
        <br />

        We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you.
        If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact
        us.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sincerely,
        <br />
        <strong>CEO, Founder</strong>
